                <h3>1. Introduction: The Core Disagreement</h3>
                <p>This theory proposes that our most basic perception of reality is inverted. We perceive a 3D "Space" through which we "move" in "Time." The reality, I argue, is that all matter exists in a state of constant, invariant motion (<span class="math">c</span>) along a unique "Temporal Axis." This true motion is "inward," into a future that cannot be perceived. "Space" is the "outward," perceivable illumination of the *past*—the relative positions and motions of all other matter, each on its own temporal path. This "profound disagreement" on the direction of time, measured by a geometric angle (<span class="math">α</span>), is the single, unifying source of relativistic effects, quantum uncertainty, and thermodynamic force.</p>

                <h3>2. The Foundational Substrate (The "Why")</h3>
                <p>The theory begins not with space or time, but with a thermodynamic foundation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="list-title">The Thermodynamic Field (TDF):</span> The universe is a singular, information-based field in a state of fundamental disequilibrium. This field is the "substrate" of reality, possessing a "Relational Fabric" that allows for connection and structure.</li>
                    <li><span class="list-title">Flux Irreversibility:</span> All physical processes are driven by a single "Thermodynamic Imperative"—the drive for the TDF to resolve its disequilibrium and return to an equilibrium state (Flux). This imperative is the fundamental "arrow of time" and the origin of all force.</li>
                    <li><span class="list-title">Fluctuations & Actualization:</span> Quantum Uncertainty is the engine of the TDF, creating spontaneous "Fluctuations" (potential information). These potentials are "Actualized" into persistent, real information (matter) only when they are "Relationalized" or entangled with the existing fabric.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>3. The Core Mechanism (The "Engine")</h3>
                <p>Once "Actualized" as persistent information (matter), a particle must obey a new set of dynamics. This is the "how" of the theory.</p>
                
                <h4>3.1. The Temporo-Gyroscopic Model</h4>
                <p>A particle of matter is a "Temporal Gyroscope." Its existence is defined by its motion *through time*.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="list-title">Primary Motion:</span> The particle's intrinsic state is a constant, invariant motion at speed <span class="math">c</span> along its own unique "Temporal Axis." This is its "spin" through time.</li>
                    <li><span class="list-title">Precessional Motion:</span> An external force (a "torque" from the Flux imperative) doesn't "push" the particle through space. It *tilts* the particle's Temporal Axis. This tilt causes the particle's true temporal motion to "precess."</li>
                    <li><span class="list-title">Emergent Space:</span> This "precessional motion" *is* what we perceive and measure as spatial velocity (<span class="math">v_s</span>). "Space" is therefore an emergent, gyroscopic property, not a fundamental container.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3.2. Stationary Light</h4>
                <p>This model inverts the role of light. Light (photons) does not "travel" at <span class="math">c</span>. Light is a *stationary* potential in the TDF's Relational Fabric. *We*, the observers, are the ones moving at <span class="math">c</span>, and our temporal motion *past* this
