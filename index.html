            <p class="author-date"><strong>Author:</strong> Jason Morbin | <strong>Status:</strong> In-Progress</p>
            
            <section>
                <h3>A Note on This Project</h3>
                <p>This website is not a formal academic paper. It is an honest repository of a multi-year exploration into a conceptual model of physics. As I am not a formally trained physicist, I am prone to errors, and many ideas here are unfinished, unproven, or may be ignorant of established facts.</p>
                <p>This is not a "theory" in the scientific sense; it is an "exploration of what could be." Its purpose is to present a set of fundamental, interconnected ideas, track their development, and invite discussion. This front page serves to distill those ideas to their basic essence.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>The Foundational Concepts</h3>
                <p>This model is built on a few core "what if" propositions. The rest of the theory is an exploration of the logical consequences of accepting them as true.</p>

                <h4>1. The Inverted Perception (The "Profound Disagreement")</h4>
                <p>The model's core proposition is that our perception of reality is inverted. We do not "move" through 3D Space while "Time" flows past us. Instead, all matter has a constant, invariant motion at speed <span class="math">c</span> along a unique "Temporal Axis." This true motion is "inward" (the future), a direction we cannot perceive. "Space" is the "outward" (past) illumination of the relative positions of all other matter. We are travelers in Time, not Space.</p>

                <h4>2. The Temporo-Gyroscopic Model</h4>
                <p>This is the mechanism for the Inverted Perception. A particle of matter is a "Temporal Gyroscope." Its intrinsic "spin" is its true motion along its Temporal Axis. What we call "spatial velocity" (<span class="math">v_s</span>) is not a primary motion, but an emergent *precession* of this gyroscope. When an external "force" (a torque) is applied, the particle's Temporal Axis tilts. This "precessional motion" is what we observe and measure as motion through Space.</p>

                <h4>3. The Thermodynamic Imperative (The "Flux")</h4>
                <p>This is the "why" that drives all motion. The universe is a single "Thermodynamic Field" (TDF) in a state of disequilibrium. All forces and interactions are an expression of a single, universal imperative—the "Flux"—for this field to resolve its disequilibrium and return to an equilibrium state. This is the true engine of the universe and the fundamental "arrow of time."</p>

                <h4>4. Emergent Reality (Space, Force, and Matter)</h4>
                <p>From these concepts, it follows that the things we consider fundamental are actually emergent properties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="list-title">Space</span> is the perceived, relational, "outward" (past) geometry of all temporal axes.</li>
                    <li><span class="list-title">Force</span> is the geometric expression of the "Flux," the "torque" that tilts temporal gyroscopes to resolve thermodynamic disequilibrium.</li>
                    <li><span class="list-title">Matter</span> is a collection of these gyroscopes, bound into structures by the influence of their mutual "temporal disagreement."</li>
                    <li><span class="list-title">Temperature</span> is the measure of the *magnitude* of this internal, geometric disagreement within a bound structure.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>5. The Geometric Bridge (The Angle <span class="math">α</span>)</h4>
                <p>This model is not just a philosophical one. It is anchored to testable reality by a single, geometric bridge. The "disagreement angle" (<span class="math">α</span>) between your temporal axis and another's is the key. This angle directly partitions your invariant motion <span class="math">c</span> into its perceived spatial (<span class="math">v_s</span>) and temporal (<span class="math">v_t</span>) components. This geometry *derives* the mathematics of Special Relativity, rather than just postulating them, starting with its core relationship:</p>
                
                <p class="math-equation">
                    sin(α) = v_s / c
                </p>

                <p>From this single, geometric link, the entire framework of relativity (the Lorentz factor, time dilation, etc.) can be derived as a matter of simple trigonometry.</p>
