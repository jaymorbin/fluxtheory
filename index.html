            <h2>A Profound Disagreement on the Direction of Time</h2>
            <p class="author-date"><strong>Author:</strong> Jason Morbin | <strong>Date:</strong> November 8th, 2025</p>
            
            <section>
                <h3>A Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>This website is not a formal academic paper. It is a home meant to preserve a multi-year, ongoing exploration into a conceptual model of physics. I am not a formally trained physicist. I am prone to errors, and many ideas here are unfinished, unproven, or may be ignorant of established facts which could even be common to those who are formally trained.</p>
                <p>Despite this uncertainty of my own ideas and the sometimes erroneous paths I've chosen to explore, I remain convinced that the basic premise upon which the ideas rest is a possibility worth exploring. The purpose of this repository is to present a set of fundamental, interconnected ideas, track their development, and invite discussion. This front page serves to distill those ideas to their foundational essence.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>The Foundational Concepts</h3>
                <p>This model is built on a few core "what if" propositions. The rest of the theory is an exploration of the logical consequences of accepting them as true.</p>

                <h4>I. Relative Temporo-Axial Disagreement</h4>
                <p>The core proposition is that our perception of reality is essentially inverted. We do not move through a three dimensional space container while time ticks by. Instead, each fundamental particle of matter is in constant, invariant motion at speed <span class="math">c</span> along a unique temporal axis. This true motion is inward (the future), a direction we cannot perceive. Space is the outward (past) propagation of information between each distinct inertial frame across relative time. Systems of matter are collections of these temporal axes influenced by interactions which are shaped by the relative geometry of their disagreement on the direction of time. The fundamental constituents of systems bound by these relative geometric interactions each invariably continue along their temporal axes inward at <span class="math">c</span>, and thus the relative information of the past is in flux outward from each of them toward all the rest. Since they are bound by interaction at unique temporal angles relative to each other, and from the perspective of any such subject frame time must always progress at <span class="math">c</span>, in every relative frame time must progress at less than <span class="math">c</span> based on how severely the angle of its temporal axis diverges from the unadulterated angle of the subject frame in perspective.</p>

                <h4>II. The Temporo-Gyroscopic Model</h4>
                <p>This model is a mechanism used to describe the point of inversion between the temporal information we perceive directly and the temporal information we perceive only indirectly. Each fundamental particle is a temporal gyroscope with innately distinct inertial frame which moves inward along a linear axis through time at <span class="math">c</span>. It possesses three spinning axes in addition to this linear in/out temporal axis. The primary spinning axis is distinct to each particle in that its mass is proportional to the energy of this spin. The remaining two axes of spin are kinetic in nature, such that from the perspective of the subject frame in the absence of external forces they remain at rest. External forces may apply energy to these kinetic axes, causing them to spin and generate an angular momentum vector which influences temporo-axial alignment. What we perceive as motion in space (<span class="math">v_s</span>) is merely the apparent precession of a temporal axis which is not the subject of the frame.</p>

                <h4>III. </h4>

                <h4>III. The Thermodynamic Imperative (The "Flux")</h4>
                <p>This is the "why" that drives all motion. The universe is a single "Thermodynamic Field" (TDF) in a state of disequilibrium. All forces and interactions are an expression of a single, universal imperative—the "Flux"—for this field to resolve its disequilibrium and return to an equilibrium state. This is the true engine of the universe and the fundamental "arrow of time."</p>

                <h4>IV. Emergent Reality (Space, Force, and Matter)</h4>
                <p>From these concepts, it follows that the things we consider fundamental are actually emergent properties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="list-title">Space</span> is the perceived, relational, "outward" (past) geometry of all temporal axes.</li>
                    <li><span class="list-title">Force</span> is the geometric expression of the "Flux," the "torque" that tilts temporal gyroscopes to resolve thermodynamic disequilibrium.</li>
                    <li><span class="list-title">Matter</span> is a collection of these gyroscopes, bound into structures by the influence of their mutual "temporal disagreement."</li>
                    <li><span class="list-title">Temperature</span> is the measure of the *magnitude* of this internal, geometric disagreement within a bound structure.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>V. The Geometric Bridge (The Angle <span class="math">α</span>)</h4>
                <p>This model is not just a philosophical one. It is anchored to testable reality by a single, geometric bridge. The "disagreement angle" (<span class="math">α</span>) between your temporal axis and another's is the key. This angle directly partitions your invariant motion <span class="math">c</span> into its perceived spatial (<span class="math">v_s</span>) and temporal (<span class="math">v_t</span>) components. This geometry *derives* the mathematics of Special Relativity, rather than just postulating them, starting with its core relationship:</p>
                
                <p class="math-equation">
                    sin(α) = v_s / c
                </p>

                <p>From this single, geometric link, the entire framework of relativity (the Lorentz factor, time dilation, etc.) can be derived as a matter of simple trigonometry.</p>
